                    Albert Einstein (/ˈaɪnstaɪn/ EYEN-styne;[4] German: [ˈalbɛɐt ˈʔaɪnʃtaɪn] ⓘ; 14 March 1879 – 18 April
                    1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist who is widely held to be one of the greatest and most
                    influential scientists of all time. Best known for developing the theory of relativity, Einstein
                    also made important contributions to quantum mechanics, and was thus a central figure in the
                    revolutionary reshaping of the scientific understanding of nature that modern physics accomplished
                    in the first decades of the twentieth century.[1][5] His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2,
                    which arises from relativity theory, has been called "the world's most famous equation".[6] He
                    received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially
                    for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect",[7] a pivotal step in the development of
                    quantum theory. His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science.[8][9] In a
                    1999 poll of 130 leading physicists worldwide by the British journal Physics World, Einstein was
                    ranked the greatest physicist of all time.[10] His intellectual achievements and originality have
                    made the word Einstein broadly synonymous with genius.[11]

                    In 1905, a year sometimes described as his annus mirabilis (miracle year), Einstein published four
                    groundbreaking papers.[12] These outlined a theory of the photoelectric effect, explained Brownian
                    motion, introduced his special theory of relativity—a theory which addressed the inability of
                    classical mechanics to account satisfactorily for the behavior of the electromagnetic field—and
                    demonstrated that if the special theory is correct, mass and energy are equivalent to each other. In
                    1915, he proposed a general theory of relativity that extended his system of mechanics to
                    incorporate gravitation. A cosmological paper that he published the following year laid out the
                    implications of general relativity for the modeling of the structure and evolution of the universe
                    as a whole.[13][14] The middle part of his career also saw him making important contributions to
                    statistical mechanics and quantum theory. Especially notable was his work on the quantum physics of
                    radiation, in which light consists of particles, subsequently called photons.

                    Albert Einstein
                    The Nobel Prize in Physics 1921

                    Born: 14 March 1879, Ulm, Germany

                    Died: 18 April 1955, Princeton, NJ, USA

                    Affiliation at the time of the award: Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut (now Max-Planck-Institut) für Physik,
                    Berlin, Germany

                    Prize motivation: “for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the
                    law
                    of the photoelectric effect”

                    Albert Einstein received his Nobel Prize one year later, in 1922.s

                <h4>Life</h4>
                <p>Albert Einstein grew up in Munich, where his father founded an electrical engineering company. After studying at the ETH university in Zurich, Einstein worked at the patent office in Bern, during which time he produced several pioneering works in the field of physics. He was later employed at universities in Bern, Zurich, and Prague, and from 1914, in Berlin. After the Nazis seized power in Germany, Einstein immigrated to the US, where he worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. Einstein married twice and had three children by his first marriage.</p>

                </h4>
                <p>If metal electrodes are exposed to light, electrical sparks between them occur more readily. For this photoelectric effect to occur, the light waves must be above a certain frequency, however. According to physics theory, the light's intensity should be critical. In one of several epoch-making studies beginning in 1905, Albert Einstein explained that light consists of quanta—packets with fixed energies corresponding to certain frequencies. One such light quantum, a photon, must have a certain minimum frequency before it can liberate an electron.</p>
